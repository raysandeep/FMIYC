## Challenges we ran into
We started creating the web application with Flask since it's easier and faster to develop. We usually do this and then migrate to a Django application. This time it was tough to do that considering our excessive dependency on AWS. We made our Flask application easily executable instead.

#### Note:
We haven't added steps to run the code since there's a lot of private access keys to be used. Contact us for more.
